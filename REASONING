Dear fellow techies,

You may be wondering why I decided to publicize this technology, and the problems it finds in real time.  I have a reason, and will begin to explain in a dialogue with appropriate journalist at the correct moment.  In the mean time, I hope that anyone can learn as much as possible with relation to securing, or detecting issues in their own source code.

I may be available for consulting by contacting me at: mike@unifieddefense.net

Thanks,
Mike
