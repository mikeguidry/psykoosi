/* distribution of fuzzing tasks

   this needs to allow direct access to all classes to insert the
   necessary memory, code, etc and then it needs to be wiped after the tasks
   are completed...
   
   so brute force, bit flip, etc can all be distributed in ranges, and
   it could be mixed with a variety of software so no single process fuzzes
   the same software consistently.. this allows it to work against
   as many programs as the injectable DLL creates information regarding
   or allows an adware network to upload multiple versions of all apps
   to fuzz everything users generally users
   
   create a server side statistics engine to keep track of all software
   on each desktop machine and focus on the ones with higher counts
   focus and emulate the top versions  (highest count) of each
   application being fuzzed
