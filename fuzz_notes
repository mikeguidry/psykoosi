detect structures throughout analysis of a DLL/PE by seeing which functions pass memory to other functions
and seeing whether multiple functions access the same relative bytes of that memory being passed (ie: buffer, handle)

this can help semi-auto locate a state machine or command process loop for software
to help with use after free bugs in browsers,etc

re-emulate instructions and/or functions using various techniques such as
modifying the data if it came from possible user controlled variables to
determine if it can be controlled/manipulated for dWORD writes, etc

try to fuzz compiler flags (seeing if instructions match intel documents
for particular things like zero flag, carry flag, etc...)
this could find a new type of bug that nobody has ever used... which could be accessable
on even secure applications


 use same technique as dfuzz for distribution (byte flip, bit flip, bit swap, etc)
 and give ranges and have 1 machine as the server (and it coudl also start clients)
 1 thread per process... dont use pthread for now... ensure simulation
 can be done over network as well...
 either using mysql, zeromq, nfs, etc... log to 1 machine as well
 maybe/could be different from the serving since serving could be taking in
 new reqursts from desktop/adware
