Issues to be solved in next versions


[Core]

- X86 can already handle all the malware tricks we are aware of. If you find
  any such instruction sequence that Capstone disassembles wrongly or fails
  completely, please report. Fixing this issue is always the top priority of
  our project.

- More optimization for better performance.

- Support more operand details for Arm, Arm64, Mips & X86, especially focus on
  non-standard instructions.

- Reduce the binary size of libraries, so Capstone can be embeded into products.


[Bindings]

- OCaml binding are broken due to many API changes. This should be fixed ASAP.
